## Explanation about Question 1
### Dependencies
A `dep` file is partitioned into blocks. 
The blocks are separated by a blank line.
Each block except for the last one must begin with a line of the form:
```
package: <package-name>
```
This may be followed by a line of the form 
```
Depends: <package-name1>|<package-name2>,...
```
and/or a line of the form:
```
Conflicts: <package-name1>,...
```

The last line of the file has the form:
```
Install: <package-name1>,...
```

Spaces between package names are allowed and 
should be ignored.
For example, the following snippets should be treated the same:
```
Depends:a,b,c
```

```
Depends : a,   b, c   
```

The meaning of each block is a definition of dependencies:
- The described package is the one listed right after `package: ` in the first line of the block.
- The list after `Depends: ` is a list of packages that need to be installed in order to install the described package. A comma means "and", a pipe means "or".
- The list after `Conflicts: ` is a list of packages that conflict with the described package -- they are not allowed to be installed if we want to install the package.

The meaning of the last line of the file is just a list of packages that we want to install.

For example, the file `benchmarks/ex1.dep` describes a scenario in which we would like to install `apache`. This package requires either `java` or `c`, and also requires either `apt` or `c`. It conflicts with the package `spring`. The package `java` depends on both `c` and `apt`. The package `apt` depends on `spring`.

The program you are implementing should either output `There is no installation plan` or
`There is an installation plan`.
In the latter case, starting from the second line of the output, the installation plan should be printed, each package in its own line.

### Examples

This repository contains some example `dep` files. 
Below is the expected results for these files:
```
$ python3 install_bool.py benchmarks/ex1.dep
There is an installation plan:
apache
c

$ python3 install_bool.py benchmarks/ex2.dep
There is no installation plan

$ python3 install_bool.py benchmarks/ex3.dep
There is an installation plan:
apt
java
apache

$ python3 install_bool.py benchmarks/ex4.dep
There is no installation plan
```

Your implementation will be tested on other files as well.

Important note: it is OK if your implementation suggests a different installation plan.

### Using `pysmt`

The file `pysmt_ex.py` shows basic usage of `pysmt`.
